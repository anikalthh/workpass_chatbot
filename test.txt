            Give this scanned copy to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). This way, MOM will have a record of your latest passport details.
            If you have a security bond from a bank or insurance company, ask them to send MOM the new security bond details before you renew your work permit. This will take up to 3 working days.
            The start date of the new security bond can be 1 day after your current work permit expires.
            If you are renewing through an employment agency, they will get you to fill in a Renewal Declaration Form.
            So in summary:
            Get a scanned copy of your new passport
            Give the scanned copy to MOM
            Ask your bank/insurance company to send new security bond details to MOM

Explanation:
The response provided by the chatbot is quite lengthy and includes multiple steps and explanations. While it does provide clear instructions on how to update passport details, it may be overwhelming for individuals with lower literacy levels. The use of technical terms such as "scanned copy," "security bond," and "Renewal Declaration Form" may also be confusing for some migrant domestic workers.

reasoning
Explanation:
The response provided is not concise and includes unnecessary information. The user is simply asking how to update their passport details, but the response includes information about renewing work permits, security bond details, and filling in a renewal declaration form. This additional information is not relevant to the user's question and makes the response longer and more confusing.
