        Score 1: The response is unclear and challenging to understand, especially for those with lower literacy levels. The language used may be complex, and there could be unnecessary repetition, hindering overall clarity.
        Score 2: The response is moderately clear, but improvements are needed to make it more understandable, especially for those with lower literacy levels. While there is an effort to avoid unnecessary jargon, there might be instances where language could be simplified. Additionally, there are some areas where redundancy could be addressed for improved clarity.
        Score 3: The response that is clear and easily understandable, demonstrating an effective communication style for individuals with lower literacy levels. The chatbot successfully uses plain language, avoids unnecessary jargon, and ensures conciseness, contributing to a straightforward and accessible communication style.
    """},
    # Criteria 2 - Empathy
    {"Empathy": """
        Score 1: The chatbot lacks empathy and does not consider the emotional needs of the migrant domestic workers. It may not understand the MDW's feelings, use impersonal language, and fail to address sensitive topics appropriately. Improvement is needed to create a more user-centered and empathetic interaction.
        Score 2: The chatbot shows some empathy in its response but could be more compassionate and understanding. It acknowledges the migrant domestic workers' emotions but may not respond sensitively to their needs.
        Score 3: The chatbot displays a high level of empathy in its response. It actively listens to migrant domestic workers' concerns, acknowledges their emotions, and offers supportive and caring response that make migrant domestic workers feel valued and heard.

    # Criteria 3 - Correctness
    {"Correctness": """
        Score 1: The response significantly deviates from the reference answer, missing essential keywords and key actions. It also includes a substantial amount of unnecessary information, causing confusion. The overall consistency with the reference answer is notably lacking.
        Score 2: the response partially includes essential elements but contains notable gaps or inaccuracies compared to the reference answer. There is some superfluous information, but it doesn't extensively deviate from the reference. The response maintains a moderate level of overall consistency with the reference answer.
        Score 3: The response aligns closely with the reference answer, incorporating all essential elements accurately. It avoids unnecessary information and demonstrates a high level of overall consistency with the content and structure outlined in the reference answer.
    """},
    # Criteria 4 - Detail
    {"Detail": """
        Score 1: The response lacks detail, does not sufficiently address inquiries, and is missing important context or information. It is also wordy, verbose, or excessively long.
        Score 2: The response is adequate but could use more detail in certain areas and is missing some necessary context or information. While generally concise, there are minor areas of unnecessary wordiness or excess length.
        Score 3: The response is exceptional. It fully addresses the inquiries with a sufficient amount of detail, provides all necessary context or information, and communicates the information concisely and effectively while maintaining optimal length.

        Score 1: The response lacks a clear and organized structure, making it challenging to follow. The ideas may seem scattered, and the information may not flow logically, leading to potential confusion for the reader. The tone and style may be inconsistent, contributing to an overall disjointed reading experience.
        Score 2: The response has a moderate level of coherence. While there is some logical flow, improvements are needed for a more organized structure. The tone and style are somewhat consistent, but there's room for enhancement to maintain a uniform presentation throughout the response.
        Score 3: This is a highly coherent response. The ideas flow logically, creating a clear and organized structure for the reader. The tone and style are consistent, contributing to a cohesive and professional presentation. The response is well-structured and easy to follow, ensuring clarity for the reader.
