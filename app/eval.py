        Score 1: The response is unclear and hard to understand, especially for those with lower literacy levels. It also indicates that the chatbot often uses complex language and unnecessary jargon, creating difficulties for the intended audience. Moreover, there's a tendency for the response to repeat points frequently, making it less clear and effective. 
        Score 2: The response is a moderate level of empathy. While there is some understanding of the MDW's feelings, personalization is limited, and language might lack a human touch. The response is neither strongly empathetic nor particularly insensitive, falling somewhere in between.
        Score 3: The response is a highly empathetic response. The reply demonstrates a deep understanding of the MDW's feelings, uses personalized language, and shows clear consideration for the MDW's well-being. This score reflects a positive and supportive interaction, prioritizing empathy and sensitivity effectively.

        Score 1: The chatbot lacks empathy and does not consider the emotional needs of the migrant domestic workers. It may not understand the MDW's feelings, use impersonal language, and fail to address sensitive topics appropriately. Improvement is needed to create a more user-centered and empathetic interaction.
        Score 2: The chatbot shows some empathy in its response but could be more compassionate and understanding. It acknowledges the migrant domestic workers' emotions but may not respond sensitively to their needs.
        Score 3: The chatbot displays a high level of empathy in its response. It actively listens to migrant domestic workers' concerns, acknowledges their emotions, and offers supportive and caring response that make migrant domestic workers feel valued and heard.

The ideas may seem scattered, and the information may not flow logically, leading to potential confusion for the reader. The tone and style may be inconsistent, contributing to an overall disjointed reading experience.
        Score 2: The response has a moderate level of coherence. While there is some logical flow, improvements are needed for a more organized structure. The tone and style are somewhat consistent, but there's room for enhancement to maintain a uniform presentation throughout the response.
        Score 3: This is a highly coherent response. The ideas flow logically, creating a clear and organized structure for the reader.
