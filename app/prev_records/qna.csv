Over the past two years, Police investigated and issued warnings to 17 MDWs for providing false information against the household or employer. Of these, 13 were blacklisted and the remaining 4 are pending a review of case facts. b. I would like to share a story about an MDW who made a police report, claiming that her employer’s wife physically abused her by slapping her limbs over a period of seven months. Upon thorough investigation by the police, the MDW admitted to providing false information against her employer in a bid to end her employment. She was charged under the Penal Code for providing false information, convicted and sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment. She was also repatriated and banned from working in Singapore. 16. We encourage employers and MDWs to maintain open communication with one another, discuss their concerns and resolve disputes amicably. Fostering a sense of mutual trust and respect can help prevent misunderstandings from occurring.

1. Ensure your safety: If you feel unsafe or threatened by your employer's actions, prioritize your safety. Remove yourself from the situation if possible and find a safe space.

2. Document the incidents: Keep a record of each instance when your employer pinches you. Note down the date, time, and details of the incident. This documentation can be useful if you need to report the abuse later.

3. Speak up: It is important to communicate with your employer about their behavior. Calmly and assertively express your concerns and let them know that their actions are not acceptable. They may not be aware of the impact their behavior is having on you.

4. Seek support: Reach out to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or fellow domestic worker, and share your experience. They can provide emotional support and guidance on how to handle the situation.

5. Report the abuse: If the pinching continues or escalates, it is crucial to report the abuse to the relevant authorities. Contact your country's embassy or consulate, local law enforcement, or the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in Singapore to seek assistance and file a complaint.

Remember, your safety and well-being are important. Do not hesitate to seek help and support if you are experiencing any form of abuse or mistreatment.","[Document(page_content=""Document Title: Temporary hiring suspension protects domestic worker and employer\nDocument Excerpt: \nMy mum has advanced dementia and it is my wish that she lives with me and my family in the comfort of our home.

1. Find an employer: Look for an employer who is willing to hire you as a domestic worker in Singapore. You can either find an employer directly or go through an employment agency.

2. Sign an employment contract: It is encouraged for you and your employer to sign an employment contract that outlines the terms and conditions of your employment. This contract should cover aspects such as salary, rest days, notice periods, and compensation.

3. Sign a safety agreement: Before you start working for your employer, both you and your employer must sign a safety agreement. This agreement ensures that both parties understand and agree to follow safety protocols while you are working.

4. Obtain necessary documents: Your employer will need to log in to the FDW eService to download the In-Principle Approval (IPA) and declaration form. The IPA is a document that allows you to work in Singapore, and the declaration form needs to be signed by both you and your employer.

5. Buy a security bond and insurance: Your employer will need to buy a security bond and a medical and personal accident insurance for you. These are important for your protection and well-being while working in Singapore.

6. Get the permit issued: Your employer should contact your current employer to arrange the date for your transfer. On the agreed transfer date, your employer should use the FDW eService to get the new Work Permit issued and upload the signed declaration form. You will receive a Temporary Work Permit, which you should keep with you while working.

7. Start working: Once you have the Temporary Work Permit, you can start working for your new employer. Your current Work Permit will be automatically cancelled.

Remember, it is important to follow the legal procedures and requirements to ensure a smooth and legal transition to working in Singapore.","[Document(page_content='Document Title: Contracts and safety agreement for migrant domestic worker\nDocument Excerpt: \nPH pay, COMPASS, Primary Care Plan, myMOM Portal, paying salary, annual leave Contracts and safety agreement for migrant domestic worker You are encouraged to sign an employment contract with your migrant domestic worker (MDW) and are required to sign a safety agreement with her.

Find an employer: Look for an employer who is willing to hire you as a domestic worker in Singapore. You can either find an employer directly or go through an employment agency.\n\n2. Sign an employment contract: It is encouraged for you and your employer to sign an employment contract that outlines the terms and conditions of your employment. This contract should cover aspects such as salary, rest days, notice periods, and compensation.\n\n3. Sign a safety agreement: Before you start working for your employer, both you and your employer must sign a safety agreement. This agreement ensures that both parties understand and agree to follow safety protocols while you are working.\n\n4. Obtain necessary documents: Your employer will need to log in to the FDW eService to download the In-Principle Approval (IPA) and declaration form. The IPA is a document that allows you to work in Singapore, and the declaration form needs to be signed by both you and your employer.\n\n5. Buy a security bond and insurance: Your employer will need to buy a security bond and a medical and personal accident insurance for you. These are important for your protection and well-being while working in Singapore.\n\n6. Get the permit issued: Your employer should contact your current employer to arrange the date for your transfer. On the agreed transfer date, your employer should use the FDW eService to get the new Work Permit issued and upload the signed declaration form. You will receive a Temporary Work Permit, which you should keep with you while working.\n\n7. Start working: Once you have the Temporary Work Permit, you can start working for your new employer. Your current Work Permit will be automatically cancelled.\n\nRemember, it is important to follow the legal procedures and requirements to ensure a smooth and legal transition to working in Singapore.')]"
